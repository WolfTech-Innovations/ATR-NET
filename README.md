# BHTTPJ - Bittorrent HTTP JSON

A privacy-focused proxy system that combines blockchain technology with multiple privacy layers including I2P, and Snowflake relays.

## Features

- üîó **Blockchain Integration** - Immutable request/response logging with PoW mining
- üßÖ **Multi-Layer Privacy**
  - I2P tunneling
  - Snowflake relay system
  - Custom traffic obfuscation
- üåê **P2P Communication** - BitTorrent-style peer discovery and data transfer
- üîê **Strong Encryption** - AES-GCM encryption with blockchain validation
- üéØ **Request Authentication** - Token-based request verification

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/WolfTech-Innovations/BHTTPJ
cd BHTTPJ

# Build the proxy
go build -o bhttpj src/main.go

# Run setup (requires sudo for Tor/I2P installation)
sudo ./bhttpj
```

## Requirements

- Go 1.19+
- Linux system
- Superuser privileges (for I2P installation)

## Usage

1. Start the proxy:
```bash
sudo ./bhttpj
```

2. Configure your browser/application to use the proxy:
```
Proxy Address: 127.0.0.1
Port: 8888
```

3. Test the connection:
```bash
curl -v -X GET  http://192.168.0.11:8888/ 'https://example.com'
```
